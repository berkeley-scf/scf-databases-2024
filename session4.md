This session is likely to be either discussion of setting up and administering databases or working with large datasets in a "data lake" context of having many data files without a formal database, focusing on Arrow.

- [Setting up an SQLite database](https://berkeley-scf.github.io/tutorial-databases/db-management#1-sqlite)
- [Setting up a PostgreSQL database](https://berkeley-scf.github.io/tutorial-databases/db-management#2-postgresql)
   - We'll need to do this on a Linux machine, so one convenient approach is to use a Docker container (a container is sort of like a virtual machine but less self-contained and easier to work with). There are some instructions in [docker.sh](https:///berkeley-scf.github.io/sql-databases-2022/docker.sh) that we'll demo.

- [Using DuckDB with external data](link TBD)
- [Using Arrow with large datasets](link TBD)
